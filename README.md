# Circuit_Solver
This is an implementation of a circuit solver using node method. As input you should fill a .txt file. The function will get the address of input and output files (.txt).
The first word at each line in the input file should be the name of an element. Acceptable elements are resistors, capacitors, inductors, coupled Inductor, dependent sources, and independent sources, and the symbols are R, C, L, ML, V or I (voltage or current), and VSVC or VSVCC (voltage or current) respectively.
